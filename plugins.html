<h1>Obdi Plugins</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>Obdi provides a framework for running scripts. A Linux System Administrator
generally works on the command line and types lots of commands to get a job
done. When these commands are repeated often, and in much the same order, they
are usually grouped together to form scripts. Obdi attempts to provide the
final step, putting a User Interface around those scripts to make using them
easier. Wrapping the scripts is achieved by extending the Obdi User Interface
using Plugins.</p>

<h2>Where are they</h2>

<p>Plugins are stored in their own Git repositories. To get a plugin, Obdi needs
to be pointed at a list that describes the plugin and also tells Obdi where to
get the plugin from. This list of plugins, or plugin repository, is also stored
in a git repository containing at least one file, named <code>repodata.json</code>.</p>

<p>After installation, Obdi has no plugins installed so doesn&rsquo;t do anything
useful. Plugin repositories need to be added to be able to install the plugins.
There are some plugin repositories available and it&rsquo;s fairly simple to create a
plugin repository of your own, and they can be stored in any public or private
Git repository.</p>

<h2>Known Plugins</h2>

<p>The following Plugins are free to use and licensed under GPLv3.</p>

<h3>Obdi Core Plugins</h3>

<p>The Obdi job viewer is here. When a script is run it is called a Job, and has a
Job ID and other information that can be viewed with this plugin.</p>

<p>Plugin repository: https://github.com/mclarkson/obdi-core-repository.git</p>

<p>Click the above link to visit the page and see the plugins.</p>

<h3>Salt Stack Plugins</h3>

<p>Plugins that wrap around Salt Stack configuration management scripts.</p>

<p>Plugin repository: https://github.com/mclarkson/obdi-salt-repository.git</p>

<p>Click the above link to visit the page and see the plugins.</p>

<p>Additional post-installation instructions and documentation are kept with the
plugins so will not be documented here. For some screen shots see the Blog
page: http://blogger.smorg.co.uk/2015/01/obdi-in-pictures.html.</p>

<h3>Dev Plugins</h3>

<p>The Hello World plugins live in Dev plugins. These are useful starting points
for writing plugins.</p>

<p>Click the above link to visit the page and see the plugins.</p>

<h3>Net Tools</h3>

<p>Genereal network tools are in this repository. It contains the Rsync Backup
plugin, useful for backing up a number of servers to a central server, which is
designed for use with zfs so supports compression, deduplication and snapshots
in time.</p>

<h2>Installing Plugins</h2>

<p>Plugins are installed using the Admin interface. Only the &lsquo;admin&rsquo; user can log
into the Admin interface.</p>

<p>Once in the Admin interface, click on the &lsquo;Plugins&rsquo; button, then &lsquo;Manage
Repositories&rsquo;. To add the &lsquo;Obdi Core Plugins&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Salt Stack Plugins&rsquo;,
paste the plugin repository http(s) URL into the &lsquo;Repository URL&rsquo; Text Entry
control.</p>

<p>Next, click &lsquo;Back&rsquo;, then &lsquo;Add Plugin&rsquo;, a list of plugins will be shown. Click
the green button to install a plugin. Only installable plugins will be shown,
so if all the plugins are installed then the list will be empty.</p>

<p>There is some more information and screen shots on the blog page:
